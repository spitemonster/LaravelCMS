            <details><summary>Read Abstract</summary>The Maker Movement can be an intimidating concept for teachers, but it is worth the small amount of uncomfortableness to learn new skills that will allow students of varying skill levels to engage in learning in many different ways to help support strong critical thinking skills. Whether through coding their own robot, 3D designing their own Medieval town, or sewing a family tree quilt, students as makers is a great way to increase student engagement and to give them the power to drive their learning into areas that are meaningful to them. To be able to accomplish this change in our educational system, students need the combined effort of the entire community. This Keynote will push you to consider alternative approaches to instruction and assessment to help reMAKE education.</details>

            <summary>Read Abstract</summary>
            This session aims to raise awareness surrounding rural broadband connectivity issues in Michigan that exacerbate the “homework gap” and negatively affect digital inclusion. According to the 2018 “Michigan Broadband Roadmap” report, an estimated 27% of Michigan students do not have access to broadband in their homes. Our panel discussion will explore a variety of approaches that can be used, such as community coalitions, changes in regulation and public/private partnerships to connect the underserved and eliminate the homework gap.

            Drafting Software Development Standards
            <details><summary>Read Abstract</summary>If your IT department is like ours at Wayne State, it produces a lot of custom source code (don’t forget provisioning scripts or database object declarations). Until December 2018, we never really had an official set of standards for how that source code and the applications and integrations that it comprises are developed and maintained. Last year, our IT Quality Assurance Director was tasked with drafting a set of standards that would form the basis for ongoing future code reviews. This presentation will cover some of the whys, hows, and what fors behind that process as well as share the final product as an example of what might come of such an effort at your organization.

            Crawl, Walk, Run: Get Started With IPv6
            <details><summary>Read Abstract</summary>IPv6 will eventually replace IPv4. However, during the transition, institutions and enterprises that deploy IPv6 won’t typically be able to start sunsetting support for IPv4 right away. So, while a valuable benefit of deploying IPv6 is the reduction (and someday elimination) of demand for IPv4 address space and network infrastructure, it will be several years before IPv6 operators will fully realize that benefit. Fortunately, implementing IPv6 does not have to be especially difficult, costly, or disruptive. IPv6 can be deployed incrementally and even opportunistically. This presentation will describe the 6 top steps that Higher Educational Institutions can take to deploy IPv6.

            Last Chance: EBS Spectrum for Rural Broadband
            <details><summary>Read Abstract</summary>Educational institutions are the only entities eligible to hold FCC licenses in the 2.5 – 2.7 GHz portion of the spectrum -- Educational Broadband Service (EBS), but there hasn’t been an application window since 1995. The FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making in 2018 to “remake” EBS. An application window for educators is proposed, but so is going directly to commercial auctions, a disaster for our rural communities. Educators cannot compete with operators, but only educators will build broadband services in low density population areas. The education community must push for the right to apply for these valuable frequencies available primarily in rural areas. They must be ready to build their own 4G/5G system if they cannot find a partner who will build where broadband services are needed most. This session will cover the latest news on the NPRM and how building your own has become surprisingly affordable.

But there is also a chorus of very smart people who are warning us about AI. While it could create an extremely bright future for humanity, AI might instead bring about our extinction. It sounds like science fiction, but if you'll keep an open mind, Josh explains through real-world examples how things could go surprisingly wrong for humans with the rise of artificial intelligence -- and might convince you to rethink how you feel about those ads for AI you see on TV.

ReactJS, Rust, Mongo, Datastax. Multi-Cloud, IoT, Edge Computing, Fog Computing. Cynefin Decision Framework. And the increasing complexity of integrating, managing, and operating all of this. Whew! The wave of emerging technologies now burgeoning around us is not letting up, and promises only to grow into the 2020s. Recent reports indicate that many skills in IT now have a useful lifecycle of only two-to-four years. For many of us, with running applications more than 8-12 years old (or 20), coping with this new world will be a watershed challenge. Which technologies matter? Which might we ignore for a while? Which are vital this year? Can we train staff quickly enough? Will there be funding for this? Can we recruit new skills? Will there be enough capacity in the global market to support hiring? Or will this be the impetus for more rapid out-sourcing, perhaps even off-shore? Join me to examine these changes now coming over our collective horizon.

There is no doubt in anyone's mind these vehicles will be on the road in greater numbers in the next few years. Although this is great, there is also a downside. These vehicles depend on their sensors to feed them dependable data. Without this, the cars potentially are bricks moving at very high speeds. The presentation will review for GPS and LiDAR the history, attacks, and defenses such that the evil-doers goal of taking over the vehicle control is excessively difficult and they will move onto the next model without these features included.

            Internet of Trusted Things: An Electrified Vehicle to Grid Perspective
            <details><summary>Read Abstract</summary>All major automotive manufacturers have announced aggressive plans to electrify their fleets within the next 5-7 years. The vast majority of these electric vehicles will have embedded connectivity, exchanging consumer and business data over edge and cloud computing networks with charging station operators, electric utilities, fleet managers, city traffic infrastructure and various third party service providers. In this highly interconnected and integrated transportation future, who and what can we trust to make decisions and take actions on our behalf? What is trust? Why does trust matter so much? How do we etch trust into the fabric of the Internet of Things to help make communities and cities smarter, cleaner and more accessible? Through interactive dialog with the audience, NextEnergy and Trillium Secure will present one possible solution; a trusted platform for connected and automated vehicles that supports multiple communication standards along with immutable blockchain architecture and intelligent machine learning.

            Wireless Transformation and Refresh Coupled With 3rd Party Security Analysis and Penetration Testing Has Paved the Way For Next Generation Student Safety Solutions
            <details><summary>Read Abstract</summary>This presentation discusses investigation and replacement of a faltering 10+ year old Wireless network on a Michigan College Campus plagued with dead zones and insufficient capacity for 21st century customer demands. The wireless network footprint includes 15 buildings spread across three campuses. A series of competitive proofs of concept studies including emphasis on ease of management and integration with security systems, led to the selection of the controllerless Aerohive™ AP650 WAPs using the latest 802.11ax standard as the core of the new system. A full campus wireless network survey was completed using the Seven Signals method to assure maximum coverage and capacity. The requirements, specifications, and design is being augmented with a 3rd party penetration test to further guide a best practices implementation plan. Finally, the planning includes the integration of the new Wireless Network system with location-based marketing, in building wayfinding, and a campus police incident response system that identifies incident witnesses and persons of interest. Investigation methods, selection criteria, and various use cases will be discussed to help you should you chose to follow a similar path.

            It seems today everyone's focus is on ten different ways to protect your organization in the cloud.  While a proper cloud migration strategy is important, Government and Educational organizations have different compliance and audit requirements that do not always make a migration the right option.  Instead of taking our foot off of the gas for on on-premise security, let's take a deep dive into what a proper security fabric should look like.  Attendees can expect to see an approach to security that will show what true security and network integration looks like, spanning firewalls, switches, access points, network and security analytics, endpoint, SD-WAN, NAC, SIEM, cameras, phones, and more.

            <details><summary>Read Abstract</summary>Censors block websites. Users circumvent with proxies. Censors block proxies. In this talk, we will describe an emerging proxy technology, called Refraction Networking, designed to be harder for censors to block than existing proxies. Instead of using individual proxy hosts that are easy to block, Refraction Networking places proxies in the network at participating ISPs. Users connect to innocuous websites whose connections pass the ISP proxy, which can invisibly redirect the user's traffic to their intended (blocked) destination. To the censor, the user-proxy communication appears indistinguishable from legitimate traffic, making it difficult for them to block. Over the past several years, a group of researchers have been working to deploy the first Refraction Networking proxies in production networks and provide service to real users in censored countries. We will describe our existing deployment, initial results, and the future of the project.
